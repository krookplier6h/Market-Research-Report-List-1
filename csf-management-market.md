<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CSF Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CSF Shunts</li><li>CSF Drainage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CSF management encompasses two primary market types: CSF shunts and CSF drainage systems. CSF shunts are devices designed to redirect cerebrospinal fluid from the brain's ventricles to another area of the body, preventing cerebrospinal fluid buildup and reducing pressure. In contrast, CSF drainage systems are used for the temporary removal of excess cerebrospinal fluid, typically employed in acute care settings. Both markets are crucial in managing conditions like hydrocephalus and ensuring patient safety and comfort.</p></p>
